# jb2-modern

This template is a fork from John Bokma's
[Pandoc template](https://github.com/john-bokma/resume-pandoc), which was based
on [Jason R. Blevins' template](http://jblevins.org/projects/cv-template/). This
custom version uses a Mustache as its template language and compiles using a
normal LaTeX distribution with some extra packages

## Required packages

- enumitem
- sectsty
